We're living in a world where most of the time it's cheaper and easier to replace a broken thing than repair it. We have gotten used to things breaking down is not a problem because getting a new one is so cheap, making quality a secondary product attribute. We are simultaniously creating a growing pile of waste and harvesting the earth for more resources to replace them and it's not sustainable. We need to both make products last longer and increase the rate of repairs vs waste. 

This problem is not an illusion, an electrical engineer in the west has a lot higher salary than a factory worker in the east. And a highly optimized manufacturing line is a lot more efficient in assembling things than a manual process. There are no artificial cost factors that could be removed to make repairing significantly cheaper.

Also it's not feasible to suddenly do a one big increase but companies need time to prepare and plan product development. And we can't have the same warranty for mobile phones, clothes, dish washers and cars, there are different limitations and expectations. Rather we need to specify product categories and roadmap the mandatory warranties for each. Rather than doubling all warranties over night we need to establish a target for doubling it for category and some.  

This is petition is requesting the European Parliament to take following actions:
- Evaluate financial impact of extending the warranties for European consumers, businesses and manufacturing.
- Extend the consumer rights directives with specification of necessary product categories and warranty roadmaps for each.
- Establish a process to regularly evaluate and update the roadmaps.
